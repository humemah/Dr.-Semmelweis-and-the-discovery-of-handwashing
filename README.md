Childbed fever was a significant threat to women giving birth in the mid-19th century, with Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis pioneering the idea of handwashing to reduce mortality rates. This project reanalyzes the historical data from Vienna General Hospital to understand the impact of handwashing on childbed fever.

Objective:
Investigate the alarming number of childbed fever deaths at the hospital.
Analyze the difference in mortality rates between clinics with and without mandatory handwashing.
Quantify the impact of handwashing on reducing childbed fever deaths .

Key Takeaways:
Clinic 1 exhibited alarming mortality rates, prompting further investigation.
The handwashing initiative, initiated by Dr. Semmelweis, led to a significant reduction in deaths.
Statistical analysis, including mean differences and bootstrap analysis, quantifies the impact and provides confidence intervals.
Dr. Semmelweis's story underscores the importance of effective communication of statistical findings in the medical field.
